## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I've just completed a quarter-long front-end project and I'd love for you to check it out! I'm working on becoming a full stack web developer and there's always more to learn. I've also been honing my UX/UI design skills, follow the link below to see what I've been up to and how far I've come in my web development journey.

## â„¹ A little information about this project:
 - This project was built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. 
 - I utilized `Bootstrap 5` for responsive design and `UIkit` for the modal element.
 - The layout was designed in Figma and served as a reference for the project. 
 - In order to achieve a consistent and visually appealing look across all pages, I also utilized a library of high quality 3D illustrations.

> p.s 
>Map of the web site with all pages in the footer section, except the "welcome" page, this page is accessible only when user >is logging / signing in.
